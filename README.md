### Description

Welcome everyone. This app was created as a part of my son's English scientific project at school. Here you'll find different Brawl Stars styled educational games.They were created on 
the interacty.com platform and placed into this app. Brawl Stars is a very popular game among children and can motivate kids to speak English more. 
English teachers are able to use the App at English lessons. I also placed here the results of my son's practical researches during his scientific project.
I used HTML,CSS,JavaScript to make the app.
